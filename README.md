# Pie Chart Illustrating US Methane Emissions in 2021
The pie chart is a graphical representation which helps to organize and show data as a percentage of a whole. This sample demonstrates how to create a Pie Chart illustrating the Methane Emission from various sources in the United States during the year 2021 using .NET MAUI (SfCircularChart).

### Customizing chart appearance
We have enhanced the appearance of our chart by customizing series appearances, highlighting specific segments, setting chart titles, and more.

### Series customization
In this example, we have customized the appearance of series elements by defining the series [StartAngle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.CircularSeries.html?tabs=tabid-5%2Ctabid-1%2Ctabid-3#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_CircularSeries_StartAngle) and [EndAngle](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.CircularSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_CircularSeries_EndAngle) and using custom [PaletteBrushes](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.ChartSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_ChartSeries_PaletteBrushes) properties. Additionally, we have highlighted a specific chart segment using the [ExplodeIndex](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.PieSeries.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_PieSeries_ExplodeIndex) property. We have also enabled series data labels and customized the data label placement, style, and connector line type. Finally, we have added the tooltip feature to display additional information or metadata when a chart segment is tapped or hovered over.

#### Adding a chart title
Chart title will provide context to the data being plotted.
